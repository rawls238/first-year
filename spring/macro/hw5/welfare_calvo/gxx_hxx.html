<b>Each of the Following 3 Programs Computes the Matrices gxx and hxx: Use the one that suits your needs best</b>   

<br><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~mu2166/2nd_order/gxx_hxx.m">gxx_hxx.m</a> 


<br><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~mu2166/2nd_order/gxx_hxx_sparse.m">gxx_hxx_sparse.m</a> (Recommended for use when gxx_hxx.m runs into memory problems. Slower than gxx_hxx.m) 


<br><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~mu2166/2nd_order/gxx_hxx_noloop.m">gxx_hxx_noloop.m</a> (Faster than gxx_hxx.m, but more prone to memory problems)
