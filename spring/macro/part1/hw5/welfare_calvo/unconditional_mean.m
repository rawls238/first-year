%[Ey,Ex] = unconditional_mean(gx, hx, gxx, hxx, gss, hss, eta, sig) 
%computes the unconditional mean of the state vector
% x and the co-state vector y
%
%Inputs: Arrays defining the second-order expansion of x and y
% as described in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (JEDC, 2004). Namely,
% hx is nx by nx
% gx is ny by nx
% hxx is nx by nx by nx
% gxx is ny by nx by nx
% hss is nx by 1
% gss is ny by 1
% eta is nx by ne
% sig is a parameter scaling the innovation to the exogenous variables 
%
%Output:  vectors Ex (nx by 1) and Ey (ny by 1) containing unconditonal means for x and y
